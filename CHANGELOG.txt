## macchina v5.0.2

- libmacchina/netbsd: fixed failing brightness readout.
- libmacchina/netbsd: (somehow) fixed failing package count readout.
- themes: the `custom_ascii.color` field is now optional, omitting it uses the
  colors provided in the text file.
- themes: color values (e.g. "Red", "Green", "Blue") are now case-insensitive. 
- general: introduce a new readout, "Session" that is appended to your Window
  Manager readout output. If the latter fails, so does the former.
