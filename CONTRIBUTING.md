Thanks for taking interest in our project, we'd love to work with you.

# You might ask yourself:

## Where do I submit my PR?

[Right here!](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/pull/new/main)

## Okay, will my PR get merged?

It depends, our highest priority is to maintain great performance throughout
feature releases. If your PR includes a kind of feature which **inherently**
hinders performance considerably, it will unfortunately be rejected.

Other than that, all contributions are welcome.

## Alright, are there any specific code styles I should be following?

`cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` are your friends.
