Thanks for taking interest in our project, we'd love to work with you.

# You might ask yourself:

# Where do I submit my PR?

[Right here!](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/pull/new/main)

# Okay, will my PR get merged?

It depends, one of our highest priorities is to maintain great performance
throughout feature releases. If your PR includes a kind of feature which
inherently hinders performance considerably, it will be rejected.

# Alright, are there any coding conventions?

We don't follow all the rules in the book, but we have a bot that will
automatically format your code the best it can when you submit a PR; the end
result is _muy bueno_ readability and _excelente_ consistency.

# Got it! Where should I start?

_libmacchina_, definitely. We're lacking a lot in the unit testing department.
Also, even though we've minimized our dependency list, we could use a hand writing our
own implementation of things.
