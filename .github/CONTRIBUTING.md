Thanks for taking interest in our project, we'd love to work with you.

We've compiled, for your convenienve, a list of the most relevant
questions and answers that you should know about before you contribute
to the project.

## Where do I submit my PR?

[Right here!](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/pull/new/main)

## Will my pull request get merged?

It depends.

Our highest priority is to maintain great performance throughout
feature releases. If your PR includes a kind of feature which
*inherently* hinders performance considerably, it will unfortunately
be rejected.

Other than that, all contributions are welcome.

## Should I follow any specific code styles?

`cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` are your friends.
