# üí¨ About <a name="about"></a>

_macchina_ lets you view system information, like your kernel version, uptime,
memory usage, processor load and much more.

If you're interested in the library _macchina_ uses to fetch system information,
have a look at [libmacchina](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/libmacchina);
fetching-related issues should be filed on that repository.

# ‚ú® What's new in `v4.0` <a name="upgrading"></a>

### Complying with the XDG base directory specification

The themes location has moved from `$XDG_DATA_HOME/macchina/themes` to
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/macchina/themes`.

**Why?**

`$XDG_DATA_HOME` is not meant for anything configuration/customization related.

### Command-line flags

We have deprecated many, if not most command-line flags after having ported them
to theme files.

**Why?**

- In previous versions, themes clashed with the main configuration file, and
  their purpose might have seemed to many as unknown.
- There are just way too many flags for a system information fetcher, running
  `--help` ends up confusing you rather than actually helping you out.
- We wanted to simplify and distinguish between the configuration file and
  themes, eliminating redundance.

**Where can I see the updated list?**

In our wiki, [follow this link](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/wiki/Usage).


### Themes

Themes have transitioned from JSON to TOML.

Why?

- Because no one can read that JSON stuff.
- Because we want there to be continuity between the configuration and theme
  files, even though they serve completely different purposes.

**Where can I view the new format?**

Take a look at the provided [example theme](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/blob/main/theme/Carbon.toml) file.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance <a name="performance"></a>

_macchina_ is lightning fast, see for yourself:

- Execution time is measured using
  [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)

## üêß Linux

This benchmark was performed using an **Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i5-3350P CPU @ 3.10GHz**

| `macchina` | 4.8 ¬± 0.4 |      4.5 |      8.1 |

## üçè macOS

# üöÄ Features <a name="features"></a>

## Themes

_macchina_ comes equipped with built-in themes that style their readouts, bars
and separators differently. You can see the list with the `--list-themes` flag
and use the one you like with `--theme <name>`. Did you know that you can [make
your own](#customization)?

Themes live outside the configuration file, so you can create a bunch of them,
and switch between them at any time.

## Bars

Bars provide a way to visualize data, through symbols rather than numbers, and
they can be enabled using the `--bar` flag.

## Doctor

_libmacchina_ can sometimes fail to fetch certain readouts, and _macchina_ has a
feature in place that allows you to see why they failed, this is done through
the `--doctor` flag.

# üîß Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>

The configuration file define the behavior of macchina, it does not allow for
much customization. See
[macchina.toml](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/blob/main/macchina.toml)
for an example configuration file.

In order for _macchina_ to be able to read the configuration file, you need to
place `macchina.toml` in:
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/macchina` on Linux and the BSDs.
- `$HOME/Library/Application Support/macchina` on macOS.
- `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}/macchina` on Windows.

# üé® Customization <a name="customization"></a>

Themes define the look, layout and styling of _macchina_.  See
[Carbon.toml](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina/blob/main/theme/Carbon.toml)
for an example theme.

In order for _macchina_ to be able to find your themes, you need to
place them in:
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/macchina/themes` on Linux and the BSDs.
- `$HOME/Library/Application Support/macchina/themes` on macOS.
- `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}/macchina/themes` on Windows.

> Note: Avoid using the names of built-in themes.

To start using your theme:

1. Run `macchina --list-themes` to verify that macchina has listed your theme.
2. Add that same name you see in your terminal to the `theme` option in `macchina.toml`
3. You're good to go! _macchina_ will start using your theme.

_macchina_, like many other open-source projects, would not be where it is right
now without the help of its contributors, thank you all so much!

- Support for **NetBSD** would not have been possible without the help and
  testing of NetBSD/pkgsrc package maintainer
  [pin](https://pkgsrc.se/bbmaint.php?maint=pin@NetBSD.org)
- Support for **macOS** and **Windows** would not have been possible without the
  help, testing and major contributions of
  [123marvin123](https://github.com/123marvin123)
- Support for **OpenWrt** and **Android** was made possible through the many
  contributions of [uttarayan21](https://github.com/uttarayan21)
